Honestly, this was a challenge. I personally felt that the assignment looked much easier than it actually was. The knowledge of javascript that I had was very very very limited and so this whole process was a struggle. From this assignment, I can truly see why we would want to use a javascript package, as it makes something like this extremely customizable and allows for various different options to be done. But, with that, as a developer. I faced many challenges that I did not think that I would face. The biggest thing was the lack of experience regarding the javascript coding. With that, it became extremely difficult for me to understand and realize why I was doing things the way I was doing them and the syntax of it. The inexperience of that really hindered me throughout this whole process. I would have liked more guidance within lectures to show us how to code in javascript and understand why things are the way they are before going into this assignment. Throughout this class, we were told to challenge the norms and understand why things are done the way they are. Yet, I felt that through this assignment, it reverted us back, as we were trying to replicate something instead of customizing something ourselves. We need assignments and work that will guide us, and I truly felt that this assignment was more of a throw in instead of guidance.
